# Zapper DEFI clone

This DEFI project is a step by me to create interactive DEFI applications using Moralis. This project allows users to check their tokens(either native or other), their Balance, their NFTs and also their transactions in Ethereum Mainnet as well as Polygon Mainnet.

## Tech Stack used:
- Polygon and Ethereum Mainnet (for Address interaction)
- Moralis (for Api integration blockchain to backend)
- Reactjs (for frontend)
- Html
- CSS
- Web3UIKit (for styling)

The work of this project is still under progress!! Stay tuned for more!!
